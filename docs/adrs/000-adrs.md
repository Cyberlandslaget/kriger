# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Multiple decisions were made inside the codebase, many without any explanation as to why the decision was made.

## Decision

Significant architectural decisions should be recorded as architectural architecture decision records (ADRs).

## Consequences

Architecture decision records should be written as significant or relevant decisions are made.
